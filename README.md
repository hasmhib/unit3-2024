DALL·E 2024-03-07 23.18.31 - Visualize a serene image of a pillow floating above the clouds under a starry night sky.

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
My client is the owner of a local pillow shop, managing her business with the help of three employees. She is facing significant challenges due to her usage of paper-based systems for managing client orders and tracking materials, which has led to inefficiencies and errors. This has led to difficulties in matching client orders with the materials ordered, causing inefficiencies and financial losses. For example, she recently encountered a situation where a large order for custom pillows was incorrectly recorded due to a misinterpretation of the handwriting on the order form. Consequently, the shop is losing money, and the stress of these financial losses is affecting the owner's quality of sleep, despite the fact that her business is designed to improve sleep quality.


## Proposed Solution
Considering the client's requirements, an adequate solution will be creating a computer program with a GUI(Graphical User Interface) that can store data in a database. Even though Xcode is one of the most popular programming languages used for macOS, I proposed to use Python. Python is a cross-platform programming language whereas Xcode is specifically designed for developing apps on Apple's platforms. As for the GUI, KivyMD is chosen for its elegance and simplicity [^1]. This GUI framework uses is structured in an object-oriented format and makes development easy compared to other GUI frameworks such as PyQT5[^2]. For the database, I have selected SQLite. SQLite is a free database that requires no additional server process and is implemented on a single file. It is designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently, making it suitable for storing all kinds of information related to the pillow company's informations [^3]. SQLite continuously updates its content, minimizing the risk of lost data in the event of a power failure or crash. Its cross-platform compatibility will enable future developers to expand the program to other platforms. In comparison to other databases available, SQLite is reliable, efficient, cost-friendly, and easy to use [^4].


## Success Criteria

### 1. User Access and Password Management:
The website keeps users separate with an encrypted login system and even if they forget their passwords, the users can change their passwords if they remember security questions. (Issue: _“I would like to have different users for my different workers. Furthermore, I am sure that I will eventually forget passwords and I will not be able to access this information.”_)

### 2. Financial Tracking Capability:
The application includes a financial tracking feature that accurately records and monitors the company's transactions such as expenses an income. (Issue: _“I suffer with an financial losses due to incorrectly recorded orders”_)

### 3. Resource Management for Production:
The application implements a resource management system within the app that specifically visualize the materials that are available for making pillows. (Issue: _"I was not able to track the materials, and there are many times when resources were over-booked, and I had to buy materials again, losing profits."_) 

### 4. Comprehensive Order and Material Management:
The application provides detailed information about order and material management by using tables and graphs such as pie charts and bar graphs. (Issue: _“There are lots of inefficiencies in order and material management and I need to calculate these every time.”_)

### 5. Order searching System:
The application allows the user to search for orders by materials. (Issue: _“I was not able to check who ordered what materials, it is difficult to check customer informations all the time.”_)

This is the visual representation of the system and how they relates to one another. This displays the input: Keyboard and Trackpad/Mouse to the output: Display. This diagram also showcases versions of the programming language (Python and KivyMD), the computer version and deatail (Processor, version, memory, etc), the module and database (python file and kivy file).

Fig. 2: _Wireframe of the PillowTrackPro_

The wireframe diagram in Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed GUI interface and navigation flow of the application. It showcases the interconnectivity between different screens, with directional arrows directs from interactive buttons to indicate the users through the app. For example, the 'Login' screen allows users to either create an account by pressing 'Signin' button or or utilize the 'Forgot Password?' option, which leads the users to resetting their password. 

Once logged in, the 'Welcome' screen serves as a central hub, directing users to various sections of the application: 'Finances', 'Customers', 'Order', and 'Inventory'. These sections are designed for specific tasks within the app. For instance, the 'Finances Screen' will present options for visualizing financial data through pie charts and bar graphs, while the 'Order Screen' facilitates order placement and tracking. Additionally, the 'CustomerScreen' is used for managing customer information and orders, and the 'InventoryScreen' provides an overview and control of material stock levels.

This is the UML diagram for the application, which displays the classes and methods that were used in its development. The diagram includes two main parent classes: MDApp and MDScreen. All subclasses inherit methods and attributes from these parent classes, as indicated by the arrows in the diagram.

The DatabaseBridge class in the diagram provides methods for establishing a connection to a SQLite3 database, searching for information within the database, saving information to the database, and closing the connection to the database.

Fig. 4: _This is the ER diagram of the PillowTrackPro_

This is the ER Diagram for the database illustrating four tables: users, finances, customers and inventory. The "users" table has a integer primary key 'id' and attributes like 'email', 'username', and 'password'. The "finances" table has a integer primary key 'id' and attributes 'current_money'. Another table "customers" has a integer primary key 'customer_id' and attributes like 'customer_address' and 'total_price_of_order'. Last table "material" has a integer priary key 'id' and two attributes 'material_name' and 'quantity'.
