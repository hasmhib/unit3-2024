# Unit 3: 

## Criteria A: Problem definition
My client is the owner of a local pillow shop, managing her business with the help of three employees. She is facing significant challenges due to her usage of paper-based systems for managing client orders and tracking materials, which has led to inefficiencies and errors. This has led to difficulties in matching client orders with the materials ordered, causing inefficiencies and financial loses. For examples, she recently encountered a situation where a large order for custom pillows was incorrectly recorded due to a misinterpretation of the handwriting on the order form. Consequently, the shop is losing money, and the stress of these financial losses is affecting the owner's quality of sleep, despite the fact that her business designed to improve sleep quality.


## Proposed Solution
Consider the client's requirements, an adaquate solution will be creating a computer program with a GUI(Graphical User Interface) that can store data into a database. Even though Xcode is one of the most popular language used in macOS, I decided to choose Python. Python is a cross-platform programming language whereas Xcode specifically designed for developing apps on Apple's platforms. Furthermore, Python uses an easy and concise syntax that emphasizes code readability, while Xcode uses a more complex and verbose syntax. I believe Python would be an adequate programming language for the solution as it is open source, it is supported in multiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS which my client are using.
